    <title>Computational Aspect of Spike Neural Network</title>
    <advisor>Dr. Kai-Min Chung, Dr. Chi-Yen Lu</advisor>
    <abstract>Motivated by the recent heuristics in spike-based neural network (SNN) that SNN is implicitly solving linear system problem, we investigated the intrinsic computational aspect of SNN. We proved that SNN is indeed solving a linear system problem and derived convergence rate. Furthermore, we observed in the simulation that the coefficients produced by SNN were usually small. As a result, we conjectured that SNN is not only solving a linear system, but also finding the smallest feasible solution, i.e. the \(\ell_1\) minimization problem. To prove this connection, we introduced the duality theorem in convex geometry and showed that SNN is approximating a projected-gradient algorithm in the dual program of \(\ell_1\) minimization problem.</abstract>

    <title>Computational and Statistical Tradeoff in Graphical Problems</title>
    <advisor>Professor I-Hsiang Wang</advisor>
    <abstract> In this work, we studied the computational and statistical tradeoff in graphical problems. First, we investigated the information-theoretic limit of the hidden subgraph problem and derived some early-stage results. As to the computational part, motivated by the computational connection of the planted clique problem and some high-dimensional statistics problem,we found sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy being a powerful tools. Currently, we are working on applying SOS techniques for the hidden subgraph problems.</abstract>

    <title>Computational and Statistical Gaps in Mixture Models</title>
    <advisor>Professor I-Hsiang Wang</advisor>
    <abstract>In this work, we investigated the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), in which the data are assumed to be generated from a distribution consisting of weighted Gaussian components with different means and variances. There are two common problems for GMM: Locating the components and counting the number of components. The two problems are related, as we can count the number of components simply by the results of locating. However, the opposite direction is not as straightforward, so we proposed an interesting question: Are there separations between counting and locating in sample or time complexities?
For the sample complexity part, I found interesting separation results in the case where there are only one or two components. One of the findings was a quadratic difference in the distance parameter (i.e., the minimum distance between components) when the components are not too close to each other. As we are working on extending to general cases, these discoveries hinted the potential of designing algorithms for applications that only care about counting (e.g., counting the number of persons in a picture).</abstract>

    <title>Dynamic Difficulty Scheme in Bitcoin</title>
    <advisor>Advisor: Professor Professor Shih-Wei Liao, Dr. I-Ping Tu</advisor>
    <abstract>Bitcoin is the first secure decentralized electronic currency system. However, it is known to be inefficient and has the hazard of double spending. In this paper, we aimed to improve the intrinsic overhead of Bitcoin construction and decrease the probability of double spending. To fulfill our goal, we first formalized a Bitcoin-based decentralized secure network model in order to present a quantitative analysis. Next, to resolve the risk of double spending, we proposed a mechanism to dynamically modify the difficulty of each participants in the sense that those who wins more recently has less probability to win next time. To analyze the performance of the dynamic difficulty mechanism, we observed that the dynamics of the system enjoys a high-order Markov property, which can be modeled with a high- dimensional transition matrix. Finally, using the high-order Markov chain model, we showed that the dynamic difficulty mechanism effectively decreases the probability of double spending and results in a more efficient Bitcoin-based system without sacrificing the security.</abstract>
